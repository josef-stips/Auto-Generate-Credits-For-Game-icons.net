# Auto-Generate-Credits-For-Game-icons.net
The script facilitates the automatic creation of a credits file for SVG icons downloaded from Game-icons.net. It scans a folder for SVG files, extracts the file names, and automatically searches for the authors of the icons on Game-icons.net. The results are saved in a TXT file to assign credits for each icon.
