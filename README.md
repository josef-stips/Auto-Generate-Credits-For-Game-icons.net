# Project Name

## Description

This script automates the generation of a credits file for SVG icons obtained from Game-icons.net. It scans a designated folder for SVG files, extracts their filenames, and automatically queries Game-icons.net to find the respective authors. The script then compiles this information into a TXT file, crediting each icon's author.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.

## Usage

1. Set a folder path which contains all your svg icons.
2. Execute the script using `node your_script.js`.
3. The output will be stored in the `CREDITS.TXT` file within the same or a costum directory.

## Credits

Icons courtesy of Game-icons.net. Each icon's credit is automatically attributed within the generated output file.
